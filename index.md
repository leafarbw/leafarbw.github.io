I am electrical Engineering Major currently pursing my education at CSUF where I plan to graduate in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120 Labs

Lab 4
This lab is really cool because it lets us build a full C++ program from scratch that converts milliliters into U.S. customary units while practicing real software-engineering workflows. We get to work with a partner, write functions, compile with Makefiles, and debug real compile-time, runtime, and logic errors just like professional developers. Plus, the automated testing, formatting tools, and final GitHub push make the whole experience feel like true industry-level coding.

Lab 5
This lab is awesome because it teaches us how real software engineers build modular programs by splitting code across multiple files and using unit tests to verify correctness. We get hands-on practice writing functions, debugging with Makefile tools, and running automated tests that feel like true industry workflows. It’s a cool way to learn how professional C++ projects are structured while building a simple but fully tested rectangle-area calculator.

Lab 6
This lab is really cool because it lets us tackle real-world parking rules by writing a C++ program that interprets street signs just like an actual parking-enforcement app would. We get to practice input validation, Boolean logic, modular programming, and automated testing while working with multiple files and realistic rule systems. It feels like building a small but legit software system that makes real decisions based on time, day, and location.
